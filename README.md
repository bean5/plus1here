README

Bothered when someone does a +1 with no other text? Propose an issue on how to fix it. Vent, collaborate, and perhaps write some code.

Want to do a +1 a hundred times and not be called out for it? Just navigate to https://github.com/bean5/plus1here/issues/1

Collaboration rules
---
* Obey all GitHub rules
* Do not call people out for doing +1 on issue #1. If that issue starts to spam your inbox, consider unfollowing that 1 issue. (I didn't have to make the issue, but it was bound to be created by someone anyways.)
* This project may become something else. I am giving liberal control to GitHub users at large to change this repository as they see fit.
